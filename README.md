Dear Mas Muhsin,

I apologize that I couldn't finish this project appropriately. I need to understand the logic one by one while implementing the codes to fully understand what I'm doing. I am a slow learner of this new stuff and had limited time to do this. I will finish this project by tomorrow or, at the latest the end of the week. Thank you so much.

Library:
- Tailwind CSS
- Flowbite tailwind component for the modal
- React Icons

note :
- I use conditional logic to replace the navbar button with "member" (navbar with voucher button + logout button) navbar after login.
  it still didn't go as I wished, so you need to refresh or move to other pages first after login.
