Dear Mas Muhsin,

I apologize that I couldn't finish this project appropriately. I need to understand the logic one by one while implementing the codes to fully understand what I'm doing. I am a slow learner of this new stuff and had limited time to do this. I will finish this project by tomorrow or, at the latest the end of the week. Thank you so much.




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- Using Tailwind CSS
- Using flowbite tailwind component for the modal
